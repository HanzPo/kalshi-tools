# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Kalshi Tools is a Vite-powered React and TypeScript application. Keep all feature code under `src/`. Use `src/components` for UI blocks, `src/utils` for shared helpers, and `src/assets` for static resources referenced by the bundle. Place files needed at runtime but not processed by Vite in `public/`. The `dist/` directory is generated by builds—never edit it manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` — install dependencies; rerun when `package-lock.json` changes.
- `npm run dev` — start the Vite dev server with hot module reload.
- `npm run build` — run TypeScript checks and emit the production bundle into `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built assets locally for final verification.
- `npm run lint` — enforce ESLint rules (configured via `eslint.config.js` and `.eslintrc.cjs`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow the existing 2-space indentation in `.tsx` and `.ts` files. Name React components and files in `PascalCase` (for example, `PriceChart.tsx`). Custom hooks stay in `src/utils` or `src/components` with a `use` prefix. Prefer functional components and typed props. Keep styles modular—co-locate new CSS alongside components or extend `App.css` when truly global.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated tests are not yet configured. When introducing them, prefer Vitest with React Testing Library, place specs next to the component (`ComponentName.test.tsx`), and add an `npm run test` script. Until then, rely on `npm run preview` for regression checks and document manual test steps in PRs. Aim for coverage around critical calculations in `src/utils` and chart rendering logic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent commits use short, imperative subjects (for example, `Replace external font link with npm package`). Follow the same style, keep scope focused, and update the lockfile in the same commit when dependencies change. Pull requests should link related issues, summarize behavior changes, attach UI screenshots for visual updates, and list the commands you ran (lint, build, preview) so reviewers can reproduce.
